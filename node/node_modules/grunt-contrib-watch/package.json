  "readme": "# grunt-contrib-watch [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-watch.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-watch)\n\n> Run predefined tasks whenever watched file patterns are added, changed or deleted.\n\n\n\n## Getting Started\nThis plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.0`\n\nIf you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:\n\n```shell\nnpm install grunt-contrib-watch --save-dev\n```\n\nOnce the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:\n\n```js\ngrunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-watch');\n```\n\n\n\n\n## Watch task\n_Run this task with the `grunt watch` command._\n\n\n### Settings\n\nThere are a number of options available. Please review the [minimatch options here](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch#options). As well as some additional options as follows:\n\n#### files\nType: `String|Array`\n\nThis defines what file patterns this task will watch. Can be a string or an array of files and/or minimatch patterns.\n\n#### tasks\nType: `String|Array`\n\nThis defines which tasks to run when a watched file event occurs.\n\n#### options.nospawn\nType: `Boolean`\nDefault: false\n\nThis instructs the watch task to not spawn task runs in a child process. Setting this option also speeds up the reaction time of the watch (usually 500ms faster for most) and allows subsequent task runs to share the same context (i.e., using a reload task). Not spawning task runs can make the watch more prone to failing so please use as needed.\n\nExample:\n```js\nwatch: {\n  scripts: {\n    files: ['**/*.js'],\n    tasks: ['livereload'],\n    options: {\n      nospawn: true,\n    },\n  },\n},\n```\n\n#### options.interrupt\nType: `Boolean`\nDefault: false\n\nAs files are modified this watch task will spawn tasks in child processes. The default behavior will only spawn a new child process per target when the previous process has finished. Set the `interrupt` option to true to terminate the previous process and spawn a new one upon later changes.\n\nExample:\n```js\nwatch: {\n  scripts: {\n    files: '**/*.js',\n    tasks: ['jshint'],\n    options: {\n      interrupt: true,\n    },\n  },\n},\n```\n\n#### options.debounceDelay\nType: `Integer`\nDefault: 500\n\nHow long to wait before emitting events in succession for the same filepath and status. For example if your `Gruntfile.js` file was `changed`, a `changed` event will only fire again after the given milliseconds.\n\nExample:\n```js\nwatch: {\n  scripts: {\n    files: '**/*.js',\n    tasks: ['jshint'],\n    options: {\n      debounceDelay: 250,\n    },\n  },\n},\n```\n\n#### options.interval\nType: `Integer`\nDefault: 100\n\nThe `interval` is passed to `fs.watchFile`. Since `interval` is only used by `fs.watchFile` and this watcher also uses `fs.watch`; it is recommended to ignore this option. *Default is 100ms*.\n\n#### options.event\nType: `String|Array`\nDefault: `'all'`\n\nSpecify the type watch event that trigger the specified task. This option can be one or many of: `'all'`, `'changed'`, `'added'` and `'deleted'`.\n\nExample:\n```js\nwatch: {\n  scripts: {\n    files: '**/*.js',\n    tasks: ['generateFileManifest'],\n    options: {\n      event: ['added', 'deleted'],\n    },\n  },\n},\n```\n\n#### options.forever\nType: `Boolean`\nDefault: true\n\nThis is *only a task level option* and cannot be configured per target. By default the watch task will duck punch `grunt.fatal` and `grunt.warn` to try and prevent them from exiting the watch process. If you don't want `grunt.fatal` and `grunt.warn` to be overridden set the `forever` option to `false`.\n\n#### options.livereload\nType: `Boolean|Number|Object`\nDefault: false\n\nSet to `true` or set `livereload: 1337` to a port number to enable live reloading. Default and recommended port is `35729`.\n\nIf enabled a live reload server will be started with the watch task per target. Then after the indicated tasks have ran, the live reload server will be triggered with the modified files.\n\nExample:\n```js\nwatch: {\n  css: {\n    files: '**/*.sass',\n    tasks: ['sass'],\n    options: {\n      livereload: true,\n    },\n  },\n},\n```\n\n### Examples\n\n```js\n// Simple config to run jshint any time a file is added, changed or deleted\ngrunt.initConfig({\n  watch: {\n    files: ['**/*'],\n    tasks: ['jshint'],\n  },\n});\n```\n\n```js\n// Advanced config. Run specific tasks when specific files are added, changed or deleted.\ngrunt.initConfig({\n  watch: {\n    gruntfile: {\n      files: 'Gruntfile.js',\n      tasks: ['jshint:gruntfile'],\n    },\n    src: {\n      files: ['lib/*.js', 'css/**/*.scss', '!lib/dontwatch.js'],\n      tasks: ['default'],\n    },\n    test: {\n      files: '<%= jshint.test.src %>',\n      tasks: ['jshint:test', 'qunit'],\n    },\n  },\n});\n```\n\n#### Using the `watch` event\nThis task will emit a `watch` event when watched files are modified. This is useful if you would like a simple notification when files are edited or if you're using this task in tandem with another task. Here is a simple example using the `watch` event:\n\n```js\ngrunt.initConfig({\n  watch: {\n    scripts: {\n      files: ['lib/*.js'],\n    },\n  },\n});\ngrunt.event.on('watch', function(action, filepath) {\n  grunt.log.writeln(filepath + ' has ' + action);\n});\n```\n\n**The `watch` event is not intended for replacing the standard Grunt API for configuring and running tasks. If you're trying to run tasks from within the `watch` event you're more than likely doing it wrong. Please read [configuring tasks](http://gruntjs.com/configuring-tasks).**\n\n##### Compiling Files As Needed\nA very common request is to only compile files as needed. Here is an example that will only lint changed files with the `jshint` task:\n\n```js\ngrunt.initConfig({\n  watch: {\n    scripts: {\n      files: ['lib/*.js'],\n      tasks: ['jshint'],\n      options: {\n        nospawn: true,\n      },\n    },\n  },\n  jshint: {\n    all: ['lib/*.js'],\n  },\n});\n\n// on watch events configure jshint:all to only run on changed file\ngrunt.event.on('watch', function(action, filepath) {\n  grunt.config(['jshint', 'all'], filepath);\n});\n```\n\nIf you need to dynamically modify your config, the `nospawn` option must be enabled to keep the watch running under the same context.\n\nIf you save multiple files simultaneously you may opt for a more robust method:\n\n```js\nvar changedFiles = Object.create(null);\nvar onChange = grunt.util._.debounce(function() {\n  grunt.config(['jshint', 'all'], Object.keys(changedFiles));\n  changedFiles = Object.create(null);\n}, 200);\ngrunt.event.on('watch', function(action, filepath) {\n  changedFiles[filepath] = action;\n  onChange();\n});\n```\n\n#### Live Reloading\nLive reloading is built into the watch task. Set the option `livereload` to `true` to enable on the default port `35729` or set to a custom port: `livereload: 1337`.\n\nThe simplest way to add live reloading to all your watch targets is by setting `livereload` to `true` at the task level. This will run a single live reload server and trigger the live reload for all your watch targets:\n\n```js\ngrunt.initConfig({\n  watch: {\n    options: {\n      livereload: true,\n    },\n    css: {\n      files: ['public/scss/*.scss'],\n      tasks: ['compass'],\n    },\n  },\n});\n```\n\nYou can also configure live reload for individual watch targets or run multiple live reload servers. Just be sure if you're starting multiple servers they operate on different ports:\n\n```js\ngrunt.initConfig({\n  watch: {\n    css: {\n      files: ['public/scss/*.scss'],\n      tasks: ['compass'],\n      options: {\n        // Start a live reload server on the default port 35729\n        livereload: true,\n      },\n    },\n    another: {\n      files: ['lib/*.js'],\n      tasks: ['anothertask'],\n      options: {\n        // Start another live reload server on port 1337\n        livereload: 1337,\n      },\n    },\n    dont: {\n      files: ['other/stuff/*'],\n      tasks: ['dostuff'],\n    },\n  },\n});\n```\n\n##### Enabling Live Reload in Your HTML\nOnce you've started a live reload server you'll be able to access the live reload script. To enable live reload on your page, add a script tag before your closing `</body>` tag pointing to the `livereload.js` script:\n\n```html\n<script src=\"http://localhost:35729/livereload.js\"></script>\n```\n\nFeel free to add this script to your template situation and toggle with some sort of `dev` flag.\n\n##### Using Live Reload with the Browser Extension\nInstead of adding a script tag to your page, you can live reload your page by installing a browser extension. Please visit [how do I install and use the browser extensions](http://feedback.livereload.com/knowledgebase/articles/86242-how-do-i-install-and-use-the-browser-extensions-) for help installing an extension for your browser.\n\nOnce installed please use the default live reload port `35729` and the browser extension will automatically reload your page without needing the `<script>` tag.\n\n##### Using Connect Middleware\nSince live reloading is used when developing, you may want to disable building for production (and are not using the browser extension). One method is to use Connect middleware to inject the script tag into your page. Try the [connect-livereload](https://github.com/intesso/connect-livereload) middleware for injecting the live reload script into your page.\n\n### FAQs\n\n#### How do I fix the error `EMFILE: Too many opened files.`?\nThis is because of your system's max opened file limit. For OSX the default is very low (256). Temporarily increase your limit with `ulimit -n 10480`, the number being the new max limit.\n\nIn some versions of OSX the above solution doesn't work. In that case try `launchctl limit maxfiles 10480 10480 ` and restart your terminal. See [here](http://superuser.com/questions/261023/how-to-change-default-ulimit-values-in-mac-os-x-10-6).\n\n#### Can I use this with Grunt v0.3?\nYes. Although `grunt-contrib-watch` is a replacement watch task for Grunt v0.4, version `grunt-contrib-watch@0.1.x` is compatible with Grunt v0.3. `grunt-contrib-watch >= 0.2.x` is **only* compatible and recommended to use with Grunt v0.4.\n\n#### Why is the watch devouring all my memory?\nLikely because of an enthusiastic pattern trying to watch thousands of files. Such as `'**/*.js'` but forgetting to exclude the `node_modules` folder with `'!node_modules/**/*.js'`. Try grouping your files within a subfolder or be more explicit with your file matching pattern.\n\n#### Why spawn as child processes as a default?\nThe goal of this watch task is as files are changed, run tasks as if they were triggered by the user themself. Each time a user runs `grunt` a process is spawned and tasks are ran in succession. In an effort to keep the experience consistent and continualy produce expected results, this watch task spawns tasks as child processes by default.\n\nSandboxing task runs also allows this watch task to run more stable over long periods of time. As well as more efficiently with more complex tasks and file structures.\n\nSpawning does cause a performance hit (usually 500ms for most environments). It also cripples tasks that rely on the watch task to share the context with each subsequent run (i.e., reload tasks). If you would like a faster watch task or need to share the context please set the `nospawn` option to `true`. Just be aware that with this option enabled, the watch task is more prone to failure.\n\n\n## Release History\n\n * 2013-05-27   v0.4.4   Remove gracefully closing SIGINT.
