  "readme": "This is a mix-and-match set of utilities that you can use to write test\nharnesses and frameworks that communicate with one another using the\nTest Anything Protocol.\n\nIf you don't yet know what TAP is, [you better ask\nsomebody](http://testanything.org/).\n\nDefault Usage:\n\n1. Make a directory.  Maybe call it 'test'.  That'd be nice and obvious.\n2. Put a bunch of test scripts in there.  If they're node programs, then\n   they should be \".js\".  Anything else is assumed to be some kind of shell\n   script, which should have a shebang line.\n3. `npm install tap`\n4. Update package.json scripts.test to include `tap ./test` [example\n   gist](https://gist.github.com/4469613)\n5. `npm test`\n\nThe output will be TAP-compliant.\n\nFor extra special bonus points, you can do something like this:\n\n    var test = require(\"tap\").test\n    test(\"make sure the thingie is a thing\", function (t) {\n      t.equal(thingie, \"thing\", \"thingie should be thing\")\n      t.type(thingie, \"string\", \"type of thingie is string\")\n      t.ok(true, \"this is always true\")\n      t.notOk(false, \"this is never true\")\n      t.test(\"a child test\", function (t) {\n        t.equal(this, superEasy, \"right!?\")\n        t.similar(7, 2, \"ever notice 7 is kinda like 2?\", {todo: true})\n        t.test(\"so skippable\", {skip: true}, function (t) {\n          t.plan(1) // only one test in this block\n          t.ok(true, \"but when the flag changes, it'll pass\")\n          // no need to end, since we had a plan.\n        })\n        t.end()\n      })\n      t.ok(99, \"can also skip individual assertions\", {skip: true})\n      // end lets it know it's over.\n      t.end()\n    })\n    test(\"another one\", function (t) {\n      t.plan(1)\n      t.ok(true, \"It's ok to plan, and also end.  Watch.\")\n      t.end() // but it must match the plan!\n    })\n\nNode-tap is actually a collection of several modules, any of which may be\nmixed and matched however you please.\n\nIf you don't like this test framework, and think you can do much much\nbetter, *I strongly encourage you to do so!*  If you use this library,\nhowever, at least to output TAP-compliant results when `process.env.TAP`\nis set, then the data coming out of your framework will be much more\nconsumable by machines.\n\nYou can also use this to build programs that *consume* the TAP data, so\nthis is very useful for CI systems and such.\n\n* tap-assert: A collection of assert functions that return TAP result\n  objects.\n* tap-consumer: A stream interface for consuming TAP data.\n* tap-producer: A class that produces a TAP stream by taking in result\n  objects.\n* tap-results: A class for keeping track of TAP result objects as they\n  pass by, counting up skips, passes, fails, and so on.\n* tap-runner: A program that runs through a directory running all the\n  tests in it.  (Tests which may or may not be TAP-outputting tests.  But\n  it's better if they are.)\n* tap-test: A class for actually running tests.\n* tap-harness: A class that runs tests.  (Tests are also Harnesses,\n  which is how sub-tests run.)\n* tap-global-harness: A default harness that provides the top-level\n  support for running TAP tests.\n\n## Experimental Code Coverage with runforcover & bunker:\n\n```\nTAP_COV=1 tap ./test [--cover=./lib,foo.js] [--cover-dir=./coverage]\n```\n\nThis feature is experimental, and will most likely change somewhat\nbefore being finalized.
