The test suite tests every feature. It doesn't cater to specific\naspects.\n\n## Install\n\n``` bash\n$ npm install marked\n```\n\n## Another Javascript Markdown Parser\n\nThe point of marked was to create a markdown compiler where it was possible to\nfrequently parse huge chunks of markdown without having to worry about\ncaching the compiled output somehow...or blocking for an unnecesarily long time.\n\nmarked is very concise and still implements all markdown features. It is also\nnow fully compatible with the client-side.\n\nmarked more or less passes the official markdown test suite in its\nentirety. This is important because a surprising number of markdown compilers\ncannot pass more than a few tests. It was very difficult to get marked as\ncompliant as it is. It could have cut corners in several areas for the sake\nof performance, but did not in order to be exactly what you expect in terms\nof a markdown rendering. In fact, this is why marked could be considered at a\ndisadvantage in the benchmarks above.\n\nAlong with implementing every markdown feature, marked also implements\n[GFM features](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/).\n\n## Options\n\nmarked has a few different switches which change behavior.\n\n- __pedantic__: Conform to obscure parts of `markdown.pl` as much as possible.\n  Don't fix any of the original markdown bugs or poor behavior.\n- __gfm__: Enable github flavored markdown (enabled by default).\n- __sanitize__: Sanitize the output. Ignore any HTML that has been input.\n- __highlight__: A callback to highlight code blocks.\n- __tables__: Enable GFM tables. This is enabled by default. (Requires the\n  `gfm` option in order to be enabled).\n- __breaks__: Enable GFM line breaks. Disabled by default.\n- __smartLists__: Use smarter list behavior than the original markdown.\n  Disabled by default. May eventually be default with the old behavior\n  moved into `pedantic`.\n- __langPrefix__: Set the prefix for code block classes. Defaults to `lang-`.\n\n## Usage\n\n``` js\n// Set default options\nmarked.setOptions({\n  gfm: true,\n  tables: true,\n  breaks: false,\n  pedantic: false,\n  sanitize: true,\n  smartLists: true,\n  langPrefix: 'language-',\n  highlight: function(code, lang) {\n    if (lang === 'js') {\n      return highlighter.javascript(code);\n    }\n    return code;\n  }\n});\nconsole.log(marked('i am using __markdown__.'));\n```\n\nYou also have direct access to the lexer and parser if you so desire.\n\n``` js\nvar tokens = marked.lexer(text, options);\nconsole.log(marked.parser(tokens));\n```\n\n``` js\nvar lexer = new marked.Lexer(options);\nvar tokens = lexer.lex(text);\nconsole.log(tokens);\nconsole.log(lexer.rules);\n```\n\n``` bash\n$ node\n> require('marked').lexer('> i am using marked.')\n[ { type: 'blockquote_start' },\n  { type: 'paragraph',\n    text: 'i am using marked.' },\n  { type: 'blockquote_end' },\n  links: {} ]\n```\n\n## CLI\n\n``` bash\n$ marked -o hello.html\nhello world\n^D\n$ cat hello.html\n<p>hello world</p>\n```\n\n## License\n\nCopyright (c) 2011-2013, Christopher Jeffrey.
