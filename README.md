# Semantic UI
Semantic is a highly themable UI framework

Semantic UI is now at 1.0, be sure to check out our [release notes](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/blob/master/RELEASE%20NOTES.md) for changes from the pre-release.

[![Flattr This](https://api.flattr.com/button/flattr-badge-large.png)](https://flattr.com/submit/auto?user_id=jlukic&url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fjlukic%2FSemantic-UI)

> Community contributed plugins and ports for Wordpress, Angular, Dart, Knockout, Rails, and more can be found on the [Integration page](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/wiki/Integration).

## Translations

Translations are available directly [in the docs](http://www.semantic-ui.com), using the language toolbar.

## Getting Started

Semantic is best used actively during development. We have included build tools for maintaining changes to Semantic as you work.

![Getting Started](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2657007/install.gif)


```
npm install
gulp
```

Running gulp for the first time will start the interactive set-up.

This helps you create two important files ``semantic.json`` which stores your folder set-up, and ``themes.config`` a central file for setting ui themes.

The install utility will also help you set-up which components you want to include in your packaged release, ignoring parts of Semantic you may not use.

Once set-up you can use these commands to maintain your project
```nodejs
gulp  // defaults to watch after install
gulp build // build all files from source
gulp clean // clears your dist folder
gulp watch // watch files
gulp install // re-runs install
gulp help // list all commands
```


### Bugs and Issues
