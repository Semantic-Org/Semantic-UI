## Getting Started

### Basic Usage (Default Theme)

We recommend setting up the Semantic build workflow to support on-the-fly
theming and customization, but it is not required.

To use the "ready-to-use" distribution version, which includes all components, simply link to
`dist/semantic.js` and `dist/semantic.css` (or their minified counterparts) in your page.

``` html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/dist/semantic.min.css">
<script src="/dist/semantic.min.js"></script>
```

You may also prefer to use individual components found in `dist/components` to reduce the libraries file size.

``` html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/dist/components/icon.css">
```


### Recommended Usage (Themed)

Semantic is best used actively during development. We have included build tools for updating your site's theme as you work.

![Getting Started](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2657007/install.gif)

```
npm install
gulp
```

Running gulp for the first time will start the interactive set-up.

This helps you create two important files ``semantic.json`` which stores your folder set-up, and ``themes.config`` a central file for setting ui themes.

The install utility will also help you set-up which components you want to include in your packaged release, ignoring parts of Semantic you may not use.

Once set-up you can use these commands to maintain your project
```nodejs
gulp  // defaults to watch after install
gulp build // build all files from source
gulp clean // clears your dist folder
gulp watch // watch files
gulp install // re-runs install
gulp help // list all commands
```

For more detail into how work with Semantic when building a site please [read out customization guide](http://learnsemantic.com/developing/customizing.html) on [LearnSemantic.com](http://learnsemantic.com/)
