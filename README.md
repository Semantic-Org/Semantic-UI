# Semantic UI

Semantic is a highly-themable UI framework with naming conventions built around common usage.

Key Features
* 50+ UI Elements
* 3000 + CSS Variables
* 3 Levels of Variable Inheritance (Similar to SublimeText)
* Built using EM values for responsive design

Semantic UI is now at 1.0, be sure to check out our [release notes](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/blob/master/RELEASE-NOTES.md) for changes from the pre-release.

## Translations

Translations are available directly [in the docs](http://www.semantic-ui.com), using the language toolbar.

## Getting Started

Semantic is best used actively during development. We have included build tools for maintaining changes to Semantic as you work.

![Getting Started](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2657007/install.gif)


```
npm install
gulp
```

Running gulp for the first time will start the interactive set-up.

This helps you create two important files ``semantic.json`` which stores your folder set-up, and ``themes.config`` a central file for setting ui themes.

The install utility will also help you set-up which components you want to include in your packaged release, ignoring parts of Semantic you may not use.

Once set-up you can use these commands to maintain your project
```nodejs
gulp  // defaults to watch after install
gulp build // build all files from source
gulp clean // clears your dist folder
gulp watch // watch files
gulp install // re-runs install
gulp help // list all commands
```
