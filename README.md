# Semantic [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI?branch=master)
Semantic is a UI Component library implemented using a set of specifications designed around natural language.

Semantic UI is under constant development, so **be sure to check out our [release notes](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/blob/master/RELEASE%20NOTES.md) for recent changes**.

> Community contributed plugins and ports for Wordpress, Angular, Dart, Knockout, Rails, and more can be found on the [Integration page](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/wiki/Integration).

### Project Status

**Semantic is being reworked for a ``1.0`` release**

Semantic may still be officially 'pre-release', but is already used in production in large sites like [Quirky](http://www.quirky.com) and [The New Republic](http://www.newrepublic.com)

Although the pre-release branch ``0.x.x`` is actively being maintained, most important features like better theming support, and new components will land in ``1.0``.

Beta documentation are available at [http://beta.semantic-ui.com](http://beta.semantic-ui.com) for testers and early adopters. Beta channel is currently available in [branch css](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/tree/css)

Check out [this GitHub Issue thread](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/691) for progress updates on 1.0 development.

## Getting Started

The Semantic library describes many UI elements. In most instances it might be best to build a custom build with only the elements you need.

To download the entire library

    git clone git@github.com:Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI.git

If you prefer to download the whole kit as a zip, it is so conveniently packaged.
