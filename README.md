## Getting Started

The Semantic library describes many UI elements. In most instances it might be best to build a custom build with only the elements you need.

To download the entire library

    git clone git@github.com:Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI.git

If you prefer to download the whole kit as a zip, it is so conveniently packaged.
