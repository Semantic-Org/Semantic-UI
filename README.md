### Bugs and Issues

> Semantic UI is production ready, but is "pre-release" until build and theming tools are available, and documentation is complete for all components.

Please [share any issues](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues?state=open) you may have, we need your help to get all the kinks out.

If you are reporting a bug *you must create a test-case*. You can [fork this jsfiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/Vbr9d/42/) to get you started.

## Browser Support

* Last 2 Versions FF, Chrome, IE (aka 10+)
* Safari 6
* IE 9+ (Browser prefix only)
* Android 4
* Blackberry 10

## Getting Started

The Semantic library describes many UI elements. In most instances it might be best to build a custom build with only the elements you need.

To download the entire library

    git clone git@github.com:Semantic-Org/semantic.git

If you prefer to download the whole kit as a zip, it is so conveniently packaged.

    http://semantic-ui.com/build/semantic.zip

**Build tools for creating customized downloads will be available in 1.0** Until then we suggest using an asset management tool like [grunt](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-cli) or [jammit](https://github.com/documentcloud/jammit) to create packaged versions for use in production.
