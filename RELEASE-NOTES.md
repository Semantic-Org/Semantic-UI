## RELEASE NOTES

### Version 2.0.0 - March xx, 2015

-**Migration Guide**

- **Modal** - If you are using a modal with image content, you will need to use `image content` on the parent element. This is because `flex` rules require parent styling that the previous `table-row` rules did not.
- **Grid** - `page grid` have been modified to have fixed widths. Fluid grid gutters make it very difficult to style responsive page content because they continuously adjust with the browser. Moving forward we will be recommending using `ui container` a fixed width container for holding page contents.
- **Form Validation** - Form validation now passes settings through a `fields` object, the previous syntax will continue to work but produce deprecation notices in console

**New UI**
- **Container** - Containers are fixed width containers meant for holding page contents, and are a simpler alternative to `ui page grid`, view more [examples in docs](http://www.semantic-ui.com/elements/container.html#examples)
- **Multiselect** - New dropdown types has been added for multi-select, including tagging/tokenizing features
- **Headers** - Added new header type `sub header`, useful for displaying small headers alongside text content. See examples [in the header docs](http://www.semantic-ui.com/elements/header.html#sub-headers)
- **Menu** - New UI `vertical tabular menu` is now available with `menu`
- **Modal** - Add new settings `blurring` and `inverted` which are simple shortcuts for setting modal's dimmer to use either blurring or inverted variations.
- **Dropdown** - Added new dropdown variation `scrolling dropdown` and `scrolling menu`, see docs or try it out with the language menu in the navigation bar
- **Image** - Images now include a `spaced` variation for adding whitespace around images when used inline with text.
- **Dimmer** - Dimmers now have a `blurring` variation which apply a glass-like effect when dimmed
- **Popup** - Popups now  default as `exclusive: false` and will not hide other popups when opening
- **Steps** - Steps can now be attached to other UI like `segment`
- **Table** - Adds `selectable table` variation, which shows hover effect on row when hovering

**Major Changes**
- **API** - API can now be used with custom XHR backends. `mockResponse` can be used to resolve request with a local function that receives the same settings as the server. `mockResponseAsync` allows you to specify to  server response from a custom async callback.
- **Card** - Cards now support multiple `content` blocks, and varied orders, for example content above or below an image or both
- **Colors** - Global colors defaults have been adjusted to improve contrast with white text
- **Dropdown** - Nested scrolling menus can now use keyboard selection and filter with inline search. Nested menu scroll position will automatically adjust with keyboard selection.
- **Dropdowns** - Added ability to add custom choices to all search selection dropdowns (multi/single) using `allowAdditions: true` setting. Search now displays error messages on no results in all cases.
- **Grid** - Grids are now based on `flexbox`, columns are now `equal height` by default. Flexbox alignment has been added for easier vertical alignment.
- **Multiple UI** - Many components now use flexbox, which means previous confusing fixes like `font-size: 0;` to remove [white-space from inline block](https://css-tricks.com/fighting-the-space-between-inline-block-elements/) have been removed. This means any element can be a direct child of `grid` or `menu`.
- **Menu** - Menu now uses flexbox. This allows menu items to match each others heights regardless of each items content size. `right menu` content should now follow other menu content instead of preceding it (no longer uses float).
- **Grid** - Grids are now `flexbox` and `equal height` by default, the `equal height` variation can safely be removed
- **Transition** - Fallback javascript animations have been removed from some UI components like dropdown and popup to reduce redundant code, increase performance (can remove `:visible`, and `:hidden` checks) and reduce filesizes.
- **Form Validation** - Form validation now uses a single `settings` object like other modules. Using `(fields, settings)` will continue to work but will produce a deprecation notifications in `console`
- **Form Validation** - Form validation now supports several validation for multiple
- **Item** - Item now uses `flexbox` for layout
- **Message** - `icon message` now uses `flexbox`
- **Input** - All `input` types use `flexbox`
- **Shapes** - Shapes now animate height/width when side changes sizes and now correctly adjusts for margin on shape elements
- **Steps** - Steps now use `flexbox`, the default horizontal theme has the active element point downward now instead of to the right. Steps no longer need `item count` and will automatically divide evenly
- **Transition** - Transition has been optimized to be more performant.

### Version 1.9.2 - February 19, 2015

Added new repositories for css and less only versions, can be installed with
```bash
npm install semantic-ui-less
npm install semantic-ui-css
```

**Bug Fixes**

- **Modal** - Fixes typo causing `middle aligned` image not to work correctly.
- **Build** - `gulp watch` now compiles concatenated css (missing in `1.9.1` only)

### Version 1.9.1 - February 18, 2015

**LESS Changes**

Importing individual components into other less files now requires scoping. This is to prevent issues with variable scope that cannot be resolved inside definitions.

```less
/* Import a specific component */
& { @import 'src/definitions/elements/button'; }
```

Importing `semantic.less` still does not require any special syntax
@import 'src/semantic';


**Bugs**
- Fixed issue directly importing `semantic.less` caused by variable scoping in `.loadOverrides()`.
- Fix bug where `equal height` row could not be `centered`, or less than full width

### Version 1.9.0 - February 17, 2015

### Build Tools

##### NPM Install

- `npm install semantic-ui` is now the recommended path for getting Semantic UI
- Added `npm` `post-install` scripts which automatically install or update semantic

##### Gulp Task Imports

- Semantic tasks are now each defined [in their own file](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/tree/master/tasks), and can be directly imported into external gulpfiles. Read more about [importing tasks here](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/blob/next/src/README.md)
- If you are using Grunt, you may be able to import these tasks using [Grunt-gulp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-gulp)

##### LESS Component Imports

- Semantic LESS files can now be directly included in other LESS files.
* You can import all UI with `@import 'src/semantic';`
* You can also import individual definitions using `@import 'src/definitions/elements/button'`.

[View Commits](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/compare/1.7.3...1.8.0)

**Key Features**

- **Form** - Form now has new methods `reset`, `clear`, `set value(s)`, and `read value(s)` for modifying and reading form data. Check docs for details on implementation. **Thanks @mktm**
- **Search** - Search `onSelect` now recieves JSON object matching currently selected element, you can now programmatically retrieve result JSON using `.search('get result', 'query')` or `.search('get results')`. `get result` will default to current value unless specified as first parameter.
- **Transition** - Added many new transitions, and new directions for existing transitions **Thanks @ph7vc**
- **Dropdown** - Dropdown now stores `placeholder text` (prompt text) as separate from `default text` (text set on page load). You can now reset placeholder conditions using `$('.ui.dropdown').dropdown('clear');``

**Enhancements**
- **API** - Added new behavior `$.api('abort')` which cancels current request
- **Dropdown** - Keyboard navigation will now allow opening of sub menus with right/left arrow. Enter will open sub-menus on an unselectable category (`allowCategorySelection: false`) as well.
- **Dropdown** - Mutation observers will now observe changed in `<select>` values after initialization, and will automatically update dropdown menu when changed
- **Dropdown** - Dropdown behavior `set selected` will now also call `set value` automatically, so you do not have to invoke two behaviors to update a `selection dropdown` **Thanks @mktm**
- **Form** - Form will now prevent browsers from resubmitting form repeatedly when keydown is pressed on input field.
- **Header** - Content headers now inherit `@h1-h6` sizes from `site.variables`
- **Header** - Sub headers now adjust in size depending on header size, added new variables for subheader resizing
- **Search** - Greatly reduced search delay from `300ms` to `100ms`. Previous request will automatically abort `xhr` when new request made
- **Search** - Search `onSelect` and `onResultsAdd` can now cancel default actions by returning `false`.
- **Transition** - Transition duration now defaults to what is specified in `css`, to set custom duration you can still pass at run-time as a different value. Animation duration no longer set by default during animation.
- **Transition** - Transition will now prevent repeated animations when using an inferred direction i.e. animation without `in` or `out` specified. When `queue: true` only animations with explicit direction, e.g. `fade in`, will be ignored when called repeatedly.

**Bugs**
- **API** - Fixed bug where `$.api('get xhr')` was not correctly returning xhr promise
- **API** - Fixed bug where API would query resource immediately when specifying `on: false`
- **Button** - ``ui vertical basic buttons` now have dividers in default theme
- **Button** - Fixes formatting for `disabled button` inside `ui buttons`
- **Checkbox** - Checkbox now only modifies `input[type="radio"]` and `input[type="checkbox"]` ignoring any other inputs
- **Dropdown** - Dropdown no longer will not show menu when no `item` are present in menu. Dropdown will now only filter results for `ui search dropdown` #1632 **Thanks PSyton**.

- **Popup** - Popup will now only use a max of one element when `settings.popup` mistakingly passes multiple DOM elements
- **Popup** - Popups will now by default appear over all UI content, even dimmers.
- **Search** - Search results no longer hide/show when user changes tab or page loses focus
- **Sidebar** - Fixed bug with `pusher` inheriting first child margins due to `margin-collapse`
- **Sidebar** - Mobile `is mobile` was using RegExp `test()` which would return an incorrect value when called multiple times
- **Sidebar** - Sidebar will now only close if you click on `pusher` or underlayed `body` (scale out). Clicking on fixed elements will not close sidebar.
- **Transition** - Fixed bug with animations that contain the strings 'in' or 'out' as part of their names, for example "swing"
- **Sticky** - Fixes issue with container size not being set explicitly on rail due to improper method renaming

### Version 1.7.3 - January 16, 2015

- **Installer** - Fix issue with component list in `semantic.json` not correctly overriding default components

### Version 1.7.(1-2) - January 15, 2015

**Bugs**

- **Installer** - Fixes installer not including RTL parameter correctly
- **UI** - Fixes `progress`, `ad`, and `sidebar` not loading `.override` files correctly
- Removed undocumented components from `theme.config.example`

### Version 1.7.0 - January 14, 2015

**Major Changes**
- **Project** - Right-to-left (RTL) support added. New gulp tasks for RTL file generation and install setting. Docs however do not yet support RTL.*Thanks @MohammadYounes for constant support with RTL!*.
- **Project** - Install now let you specify the outputted file permissions (express/custom install)

**Enhancements / Changes**
- **Grid** - Added `equal width` variation using `flex-box`, `equal height` now also uses `flex-box` (this may have to be removed if causes unexpected browser issues)
- **Sidebar** - Having a sidebar visible on page load is now much simpler. You can include ``ui visible sidebar`` on page load to have a sidebar element appear on page load. To close call `$('.ui.sidebar').sidebar('hide')`
- **Sidebar** - Added documentation on using sidebar on a custom context. Sidebars using a custom context no longer add background colors like those initialized on `body`
- **Site** - Form input highlighting color added (helps differentiate form colors with autocompleted fields). Default text highlighting color moved from highlighter yellow to a mellow blue.
- **Dropdown** - Javascript Dropdown can now be disabled by adding ``disabled` class. No need to call `destroy`. **Thanks Psyton**
- **Dropdown** - Search dropdown input can now have backgrounds. Fixes issues with autocompleted search dropdowns which have forced yellow "autocompleted" bg.
- **Dropdown** - Fix issue with search selection not correctly matching when values are not strings
- **Progress** - Progress bars can now display percent or amount left using `{value}` in text templates
- **Dropdown** - New `upward dropdown` variation, which opens its menu upward. Default animation now uses ``settings.transition = 'auto'` and determines direction of animation based on menu direction
- **Dropdown** - Dropdown matching fields without values now trims whitespace by default
- **Checkbox** - Checkbox now toggles on spacebar when focused (previously only toggled on enter key).
- **Popup** - Popup now uses its own custom method for determining `offsetParent` meaning 3D contexts (like inside an animation) no longer should break positioning
- **Popup** - Popup now uses `preserve: false` by default, this is slightly less performant but will reduce page clutter caused by leaving generated elements in the DOM

**Code / Build**
- **Build** - `Dist/` files now set file permissions in build. `644` by default. Can adjust in `semantic.json` or during gulp install. You will need to run `npm install` to add the new gulp-chmod dependency *Thanks @PeterDaveHello*
- **Sidebar** - `setup layout` not occurs synchronously if you initialize a sidebar without the proper html. This makes sure calls to sidebar will occur correctly before the page is setup. A new setting `delaySetup` will override this, increasing performance.
- **Modules** - Remove use of deprecated `.size()` for `.length` across all modules
- **Modules** - Use of `$.proxy` swapped to native `function.call()` for performance gains across all modules

**Bugs**
- **Video** - Video component now uses `//` instead of defaulting to `http`

- **Button** - Fix issue with labeled icon groups in material theme
- **Progress** - Fixes bug with progress that use ``total`` and ``value`` receiving the wrong values for text templates
- **List** - Fix some styling issues with `ui list` inside `ui menu`

### Version 1.6.0 - January 05, 2015

**Build**
- **Dist** - Build will now output version number in comment banner

**Updates / Enhancements**
- **Accordion** - Child element animations now use ``$.fn.transition`` and css animations by default (if available)
- **Accordion** - Added ``animateChildren`` option to disable/enable opacity animation on child elements
- **Accordion** - Accordion now uses `easeOutQuint`` instead of ``easeInOutQuint`` to increase perceived responsiveness of drawers
- **Grid** - ``stackable grid`` now only adds horizontal padding when using ``stackable page grid``, otherwise content will take up full width of parent element

**Bugs**
- **Tab/Segment** - Fixes first tab being 1pixel taller than all other tabs
- **Popup** - Fix issue with `ui popup` receiving error ``$offsetParent is undefined`` when using a pre-defined popup
