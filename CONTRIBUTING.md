### Bugs & Issues

Please submit any bugs you encounter when using the library to our [Github Issues Tracker](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues).

When submiting a bug report, please include a set of steps to reproduce the issue and any related information, browser, OS etc. If we can't see the issue then it will make solving things much more difficult.

Please create a fork of this [jsfiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/efp8z6Ln/) to demonstrate bugs.
